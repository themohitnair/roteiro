import "./globals.css";
import Navbar from "./navbar";
import Script from "next/script";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Roteiro",
  description: "Know your movies.",
  icons: {
    icon: "/roteiro.svg",
  },
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{ children: React.ReactNode }>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Navbar />
        {children}
        <Script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

        width="30"
        height="30"
        className="d-inline-block align-text-top me-2"
      />
      roteiro
    </Link>
    {/* Navbar content */}
  </div>
</nav>
```

**Bootstrap Components Used:**

    <input
      type="text"
      className="form-control"
      placeholder="Search for a movie..."
      value={query}
      onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}
      aria-label="Search for a movie"
    />
    <button
      className="btn btn-primary d-flex align-items-center gap-2"
      type="submit"
      disabled={isLoading}
    >
      <Search size={18} />
      {isLoading ? "Searching..." : "Search"}
    </button>
  </div>
</form>
```

**Filter System:**

```tsx
<div className="card mb-4">
